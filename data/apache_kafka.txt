When Connect workers in Apache Kafka 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, or 2.3.0 are
configured with one or more config providers, and a connector is created/updated on 
that Connect cluster to use an externalized secret variable in a substring of a 
connector configuration property value (the externalized secret variable is not the
whole configuration property value), then any client can issue a request to 
the same Connect cluster to obtain the connector's task configurations and 
the response will contain the plaintext secret rather than the externalized secrets variable.
Users should upgrade to 2.2.2 or higher, or 2.3.1 or higher
where this vulnerability has been fixed.@In Apache Kafka versions between 0.11.0.0 and 2.1.0, it is possible to manually
craft a Produce request which bypasses transaction/idempotent ACL validation.
Only authenticated clients with Write permission on the respective topics are
able to exploit this vulnerability. Users should upgrade to 2.1.1 or later
where this vulnerability has been fixed.
